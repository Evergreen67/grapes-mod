Grapes Mod - Forge 1.20.1 project (prepared)

What this is:
- A ready-to-import Forge mod project skeleton for Minecraft 1.20.1 (Forge 1.20.1-47.4.10)
- Includes Java source (com.yourname.grapes) and resources (assets/grapes, data/grapes)
- You still need Java 17 and Gradle (or the Forge MDK wrapper) to build.

How to use:
1. Open this folder in IntelliJ or Eclipse as a Gradle project.
2. If using command line: run `./gradlew build` (Unix) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows).
   - Gradle will download Forge and set up the workspace.
3. The built mod jar will be in `build/libs/`.
